1. Print out a table to show the value of T from the infinite set:
T = 4 - 4/3 + 4/5 - 4/7 + 4/9 - 4/11 + ...
Number of iterations is input by the user.
2. Write a program that prints a table of the binary, octal and hexadecimal equivalents of the decimal numbers in range 1-256.
(Read the book, Appendix D to know more)

Functions:
1. Create functions to calculate:
  a. Sum, Difference, Product, Quotient of 2 double-precision floating point numbers.
  b. Factorial of a number using:
    i. Iterative method.
    ii. Recursive method.
  c. Binary value of a decimal number.
2. Write a program using switch statement to ask for user input and do any of the calculations in the problem above.
3. Write a program to print out fibonacci numbers (the number of terms to print out is input by user).
Hint: Use a recursive function.
