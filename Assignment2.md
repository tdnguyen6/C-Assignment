1. Cin and cout your name WITH SPACES.
2. Arithmetic operations with 2 integers:
    1. Write a program to input 2 integers and output the sum of them.
    2. Write a program to input 2 integers and output the difference of them.
    3. Write a program to input 2 integers and output the product of them.
    4. Write a program to input 2 integers: a, b and output a^b.
    5. Write a program to input 2 integers: a, b and output:
    * quotient
    * remainder 
    
    of a / b (_**Notice:** divide any number by 0 is an error_).
3. Arithmetic operations with many integers (only sum, difference, product and quotient):
do the same as question 2 but:
    1. let user input an arbitrary number of integers, after each integer input, ask them if they want to input more or stop and see the result.
    2. after printing the result, ask them if they want to do another arithmetic operation or stop and quit the program.
    3. Combine the 4 arithmetic operations into 1 big program and ask user to choose which operation to operate each time.
4. Repeat all arithmetic operations like above for floating-point (decimal) numbers, distinguish single-precision and double-precision floating point numbers.
